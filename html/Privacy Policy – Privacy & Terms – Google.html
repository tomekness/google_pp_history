<h1>Google Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>When you use our services, you’re trusting us with your information. 
We understand this is a big responsibility and work hard to protect your
 information and put you in control.</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy is meant to help you understand what information 
we collect, why we collect it, and how you can update, manage, export, 
and delete your information.</p>
<p>Effective January 22, 2019 | <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy/archive">Archived versions</a></p>
<p>We build a range of services that help millions of people daily to 
explore and interact with the world in new ways. Our services include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Google apps, sites, and devices, like Search, YouTube, and Google Home</li>
  <li>Platforms like the Chrome browser and Android operating system</li>
  <li>Products that are integrated into third-party apps and sites, like ads and embedded Google Maps</li>
</ul>
<p>You can use our services in a variety of ways to manage your privacy.
 For example, you can sign up for a Google Account if you want to create
 and manage content like emails and photos, or see more relevant search 
results. And you can use many Google services when you’re signed out or 
without creating an account at all, like searching on Google or watching
 YouTube videos. You can also choose to browse the web privately using 
Chrome in Incognito mode. And across our services, you can adjust your 
privacy settings to control what we collect and how your information is 
used.</p>
<p>To help explain things as clearly as possible, we’ve added examples, explanatory videos, and definitions for <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy/key-terms#key-terms">key terms</a>. And if you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can <a href="https://support.google.com/policies?p=privpol_privts">contact us</a>.</p>
<h1 id="infocollect">Information Google collects</h1>
<p>We want you to understand the types of information we collect as you use our services</p>
<p>We collect information to provide better services to all our users — 
from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more 
complex things like which <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy/archive/20180525-20190122?hl=en-US#footnote-useful-ads">ads you’ll find most useful</a>, <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy/archive/20180525-20190122?hl=en-US#footnote-people-online">the people who matter most to you online</a>,
 or which YouTube videos you might like. The information Google 
collects, and how that information is used, depends on how you use our 
services and how you manage your privacy controls.</p>
<p>When you’re not signed in to a Google Account, we store the information we collect with <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy/archive/20180525-20190122?hl=en-US#footnote-unique-id">unique identifiers</a> tied to the browser, application, or <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy/archive/20180525-20190122?hl=en-US#footnote-device">device</a> you’re using. This helps us do things like maintain your language preferences across browsing sessions.</p>
<p>When you’re signed in, we also collect information that we store with your Google Account, which we treat as <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy/archive/20180525-20190122?hl=en-US#footnote-personal-info">personal information</a>.</p>
<h2>Things you create or provide to us</h2>
<p>When you create a Google Account, you provide us with <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy/archive/20180525-20190122?hl=en-US#footnote-personal-info">personal information</a> that includes your name and a password. You can also choose to add a <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy/archive/20180525-20190122?hl=en-US#footnote-phone-number">phone number</a> or <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy/archive/20180525-20190122?hl=en-US#footnote-payment-info">payment information</a>
 to your account. Even if you aren’t signed in to a Google Account, you 
might choose to provide us with information — like an email address to 
receive updates about our services.</p>
<p>We also collect the content you create, upload, or receive from 
others when using our services. This includes things like email you 
write and receive, photos and videos you save, docs and spreadsheets you
 create, and comments you make on YouTube videos.</p>
<h2>Information we collect as you use our services</h2>
<h3>Your apps, browsers &amp; devices</h3>
<p>We collect information about the apps, browsers, and <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy/archive/20180525-20190122?hl=en-US#footnote-devices">devices</a>
 you use to access Google services, which helps us provide features like
 automatic product updates and dimming your screen if your battery runs 
low.</p>
<p>The information we collect includes <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy/archive/20180525-20190122?hl=en-US#footnote-unique-id">unique identifiers</a>,
 browser type and settings, device type and settings, operating system, 
mobile network information including carrier name and phone number, and

<p>We collect this information when a Google service on your device 
contacts our servers — for example, when you install an app from the 
Play Store or when a service checks for automatic updates. If you’re 
using an <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy/archive/20180525-20190122?hl=en-US#footnote-android-device">Android device with Google apps</a>,
 your device periodically contacts Google servers to provide information
 about your device and connection to our services. This information 
includes things like your device type, carrier name, crash reports, and 
which apps you've installed.</p>
<h3>Your activity</h3>
<p>We collect information about your activity in our services, which we 
use to do things like recommend a YouTube video you might like. The 
activity information we collect may include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Terms you search for</li>
  <li>Videos you watch</li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy/archive/20180525-20190122?hl=en-US#footnote-content-views">Views and interactions with content and ads</a>

 we may collect telephony log information like your phone number, 
calling-party number, receiving-party number, forwarding numbers, time 
and date of calls and messages, duration of calls, routing information, 
and types of calls.</p>
<p>You can visit your Google Account to find and manage activity information that’s saved in your account.</p>
<p><a href="https://myaccount.google.com/?utm_source=pp">Go to Google Account</a></p>
<h3>Your location information</h3>
<p>We collect information about your location when you use our services,
 which helps us offer features like driving directions for your weekend 
getaway or showtimes for movies playing near you.</p>
<p>Your location can be determined with varying degrees of accuracy by:</p>
<ul>
  <li>GPS</li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy/archive/20180525-20190122?hl=en-US#footnote-ip">IP address</a>

  </li>
</ul>
<p>The types of location data we collect depend in part on your device and account settings. For example, you can <a href="https://support.google.com/accounts?p=privpol_location">turn your Android device’s location on or off</a> using the device’s settings app. You can also turn on <a href="https://support.google.com/accounts?p=privpol_lochistory">Location History</a> if you want to create a private map of where you go with your signed-in devices.</p>
<hr>
<p>In some circumstances, Google also collects information about you from <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy/archive/20180525-20190122?hl=en-US#footnote-sources">publicly accessible sources</a>.
 For example, if your name appears in your local newspaper, Google’s 
Search engine may index that article and display it to other people if 
they search for your name. We may also collect information about you 
from trusted partners, including marketing partners who provide us with 
information about potential customers of our business services, and 
security partners who provide us with information to <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy/archive/20180525-20190122?hl=en-US#footnote-against-abuse">protect against abuse</a>. We also receive information from advertisers to provide <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy/archive/20180525-20190122?hl=en-US#footnote-ad-services">advertising and research services on their behalf</a>.</p>

<h1 id="whycollect">Why Google collects data</h1>
<p>We use data to build better services</p>
<p>We use the information we collect from all our services for the following purposes:</p>
<h3>Provide our services</h3>
<p>We use your information to <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy/archive/20180525-20190122?hl=en-US#footnote-deliver-services">deliver our services</a>,
 like processing the terms you search for in order to return results or 
helping you share content by suggesting recipients from your contacts.</p>
<h3>Maintain &amp; improve our services</h3>
<p>We also use your information to <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy/archive/20180525-20190122?hl=en-US#footnote-ensure-working">ensure our services are working as intended</a>, such as tracking outages or troubleshooting issues that you report to us. And we use your information to <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy/archive/20180525-20190122?hl=en-US#footnote-make-improvements">make improvements</a>
 to our services — for example, understanding which search terms are 
most frequently misspelled helps us improve spell-check features used 
across our services.</p>
<h3>Develop new services</h3>
<p>We use the information we collect in existing services to help us 
develop new ones. For example, understanding how people organized their 
photos in Picasa, Google’s first photos app, helped us design and launch
 Google Photos.</p>
<h3>Provide personalized services, including content and ads</h3>
<p>We use the information we collect to customize our services for you, 
including providing recommendations, personalized content, and <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy/archive/20180525-20190122?hl=en-US#footnote-customized-search">customized search results</a>. For example, <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/security-checkup?utm_source=pp">Security Checkup</a>
 provides security tips adapted to how you use Google products. And 
Google Play uses information like apps you’ve already installed and 
videos you’ve watched on YouTube to suggest new apps you might like.</p>
<p>Depending on your settings, we may also show you <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy/archive/20180525-20190122?hl=en-US#footnote-personalized-ads">personalized ads</a>
 based on your interests. For example, if you search for “mountain 
bikes,” you may see an ad for sports equipment when you’re browsing a 
site that shows ads served by Google. You can control what information 
we use to show you ads by visiting your ad settings.</p>
<ul>
  <li>We don’t show you personalized ads based on <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy/archive/20180525-20190122?hl=en-US#footnote-sensitive-categories">sensitive categories</a>, such as race, religion, sexual orientation, or health.
  </li>
  <li>We don’t share information that personally identifies you with 
advertisers, such as your name or email, unless you ask us to. For 
example, if you see an ad for a nearby flower shop and select the “tap 
to call” button, we’ll connect your call and may share your phone number
 with the flower shop.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://adssettings.google.com/?utm_source=pp">Go to Ad Settings</a></p>
<h3>Measure performance</h3>
<p>We use data for analytics and measurement to understand how our 
services are used. For example, we analyze data about your visits to our
 sites to do things like optimize product design. And we also use data 
about the ads you interact with to help advertisers understand the 
performance of their ad campaigns. We use a variety of tools to do this,
 including Google Analytics. When you visit sites that use Google 
Analytics, Google and a Google Analytics customer <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy/archive/20180525-20190122?hl=en-US#footnote-link-info">may link information</a> about your activity from that site with activity from other sites that use our ad services.</p>
<h3>Communicate with you</h3>
<p>We use information we collect, like your email address, to interact 
with you directly. For example, we may send you a notification if we 
detect suspicious activity, like an attempt to sign in to your Google 
Account from an unusual location. Or we may let you know about upcoming 
changes or improvements to our services. And if you contact Google, 
we’ll keep a record of your request in order to help solve any issues 
you might be facing.</p>
<h3>Protect Google, our users, and the public</h3>
<p>We use information to help improve the <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy/archive/20180525-20190122?hl=en-US#footnote-safety-reliability">safety and reliability</a>
 of our services. This includes detecting, preventing, and responding to
 fraud, abuse, security risks, and technical issues that could harm 
Google, our users, or the public.</p>
<hr>
<p>We use different technologies to process your information for these 
purposes. We use automated systems that analyze your content to provide 
you with things like customized search results, personalized ads, or 
other features tailored to how you use our services. And we analyze your
 content to help us <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy/archive/20180525-20190122?hl=en-US#footnote-detect-abuse">detect abuse</a> such as spam, malware, and illegal content. We also use <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy/archive/20180525-20190122?hl=en-US#footnote-algorithm">algorithms</a>
 to recognize patterns in data. For example, Google Translate helps 
people communicate across languages by detecting common language 
patterns in phrases you ask it to translate.</p>
<p>We may <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy/archive/20180525-20190122?hl=en-US#footnote-combine-info">combine the information we collect</a>
 among our services and across your devices for the purposes described 
above. For example, if you watch videos of guitar players on YouTube, 
you might see an ad for guitar lessons on a site that uses our ad 
products. Depending on your account settings, <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy/archive/20180525-20190122?hl=en-US#footnote-other-sites">your activity on other sites and apps</a> may be associated with your personal information in order to improve Google’s services and the ads delivered by Google.</p>
<p>If other users already have your email address or other information 
that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible Google 
Account information, such as your name and photo. This helps people 
identify an email coming from you, for example.</p>
<p>We’ll ask for your consent before using your information for a purpose that isn’t covered in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<h1 id="infochoices">Your privacy controls</h1>
<p>You have choices regarding the information we collect and how it's used</p>
<p>This section describes key controls for managing your privacy across our services. You can also visit the <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/privacycheckup?utm_source=pp">Privacy Checkup</a>,

 in your browser. You can also configure your browser to block all 
cookies from a specific domain or all domains. But remember that our 
services <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy/archive/20180525-20190122?hl=en-US#footnote-rely-on-cookies">rely on cookies to function properly</a>, for things like remembering your language preferences.
  </li>
  <li>Device-level settings: Your device may have controls that determine what information we collect. For example, you can <a href="https://support.google.com/websearch?p=privpol_locserp">modify location settings</a> on your Android device.
  </li>
</ul>
<h1 id="infosharing">Sharing your information</h1>
<h2>When you share your information</h2>
<p>Many of our services let you share information with other people, and
 you have control over how you share. For example, you can share videos 
on YouTube publicly or you can decide to keep your videos private. 
Remember, when you share information publicly, your content may become 
accessible through search engines, including Google Search.</p>
<p>When you’re signed in and interact with some Google services, like 
leaving comments on a YouTube video or reviewing a song in Play, your 
name and photo appear next to your activity. We may also display this 
information in <a href="https://support.google.com/accounts?p=privpol_endorse">ads depending on your Shared endorsements setting</a>.</p>
<h2>When Google shares your information</h2>
<p>We do not share your personal information with companies, 
organizations, or individuals outside of Google except in the following 
cases:</p>
<h3>With your consent</h3>
<p>We’ll share personal information outside of Google when we have your consent. For example, if you <a href="https://support.google.com/googlehome?p=privpol_homedata">use Google Home to make a reservation</a> through a booking service, we’ll get your permission before sharing your name or phone number with the restaurant. We’ll ask for your explicit consent to share any <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy/archive/20180525-20190122?hl=en-US#footnote-sensitive-info">sensitive personal information</a>.</p>
<h3>With domain administrators</h3>
<p>If you’re a student or work for an organization that uses Google services (like G Suite), your <a href="https://support.google.com/a?p=privpol_admin">domain administrator</a> and resellers who manage your account will have access to your Google Account. They may be able to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Access and retain information stored in your account, like your email</li>
  <li>View statistics regarding your account, like how many apps you install</li>
  <li>Change your account password</li>
  <li>Suspend or terminate your account access</li>
  <li>Receive your account information in order to satisfy applicable 
law, regulation, legal process, or enforceable governmental request</li>
  <li>Restrict your ability to delete or edit your information or your privacy settings</li>
</ul>
<h3>For external processing</h3>
<p>We provide personal information to our <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy/archive/20180525-20190122?hl=en-US#footnote-affiliates">affiliates</a>
 and other trusted businesses or persons to process it for us, based on 
our instructions and in compliance with our Privacy Policy and any other
 appropriate confidentiality and security measures. For example, we use 
service providers to help us with customer support.</p>
<h3>For legal reasons</h3>
<p>We will share personal information outside of Google if we have a 
good-faith belief that access, use, preservation, or disclosure of the 
information is reasonably necessary to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Meet any applicable law, regulation, <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy/archive/20180525-20190122?hl=en-US#footnote-legal">legal process, or enforceable governmental request</a>. We share information about the number and type of requests we receive from governments in our <a href="https://transparencyreport.google.com/user-data/overview">Transparency Report</a>.
  </li>
  <li>Enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations.</li>
  <li>Detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, or technical issues.</li>
  <li>Protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Google, our users, or the public as required or permitted by law.</li>
</ul>
<p>We may share <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy/archive/20180525-20190122?hl=en-US#footnote-info">non-personally identifiable information</a>
 publicly and with our partners — like publishers, advertisers, 
developers, or rights holders. For example, we share information 
publicly to <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy/archive/20180525-20190122?hl=en-US#footnote-trends">show trends</a> about the general use of our services. We also allow <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy/archive/20180525-20190122?hl=en-US#footnote-specific-partners">specific partners</a>
 to collect information from your browser or device for advertising and 
measurement purposes using their own cookies or similar technologies.</p>
<p>If Google is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, 
we’ll continue to ensure the confidentiality of your personal 
information and give affected users notice before personal information 
is transferred or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.</p>
<h1 id="infosecurity">Keeping your information secure</h1>
<p>We build security into our services to protect your information</p>
<p>All Google products are built with strong security features that 
continuously protect your information. The insights we gain from 
maintaining our services help us detect and automatically block security
 threats from ever reaching you. And if we do detect something risky 
that we think you should know about, we’ll notify you and help guide you
 through steps to stay better protected.</p>
<p>We work hard to protect you and Google from unauthorized access, 
alteration, disclosure, or destruction of information we hold, 
including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>We use encryption to keep your data private while in transit</li>
  <li>We offer a range of security features, like <a href="https://safebrowsing.google.com/?utm_source=pp">Safe Browsing</a>, Security Checkup, and <a href="https://www.google.com/landing/2step/?utm_source=pp">2 Step Verification</a> to help you protect your account
  </li>
  <li>We review our information collection, storage, and processing 
practices, including physical security measures, to prevent unauthorized
 access to our systems</li>
  <li>We restrict access to personal information to Google employees, 
contractors, and agents who need that information in order to process 
it. Anyone with this access is subject to strict contractual 
confidentiality obligations and may be disciplined or terminated if they
 fail to meet these obligations.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="infodelete">Exporting &amp; deleting your information</h1>
<p>You can export a copy of your information or delete it from your Google Account at any time</p>
<p>You can export a copy of content in your Google Account if you want to back it up or use it with a service outside of Google.</p>
<p><a href="https://takeout.google.com/?utm_source=pp">Export your data</a></p>
<p>To delete your information, you can:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Delete your content from <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy/archive/20180525-20190122?hl=en-US#footnote-delete-specific">specific Google services</a>
  </li>
  <li>Search for and then delete specific items from your account using <a href="https://myactivity.google.com/?utm_source=pp">My Activity</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/deleteservices?utm_source=pp">Delete specific Google products</a>, including your information associated with those products
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/deleteaccount?utm_source=pp">Delete your entire Google Account</a>
  </li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://myaccount.google.com/preferences?utm_source=pp#deleteservices">Delete your information</a></p>
<p>In some cases, we retain data for limited periods when it needs to be
 kept for legitimate business or legal purposes. You can read about 
Google’s <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/retention">data retention periods</a>, including how long it takes us to delete your information.</p>
<p>We try to ensure that our services protect information from 
accidental or malicious deletion. Because of this, there may be delays 
between when you delete something and when copies are deleted from our 
active and backup systems.</p>
<h1 id="enforcement">Compliance &amp; cooperation with regulators</h1>
<p>We regularly review this Privacy Policy and make sure that we process your information in ways that comply with it.</p>
<h2>Data transfers</h2>
<p>We maintain <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy/archive/20180525-20190122?hl=en-US#footnote-servers">servers around the world</a>
 and your information may be processed on servers located outside of the
 country where you live. Data protection laws vary among countries, with
 some providing more protection than others. Regardless of where your 
information is processed, we apply the same protections described in 
this policy. We also comply with certain <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy/frameworks">legal frameworks</a> relating to the transfer of data, such as the EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield Frameworks.</p>
<p>When we receive formal written complaints, we respond by contacting 
the person who made the complaint. We work with the appropriate 
regulatory authorities, including local data protection authorities, to 
resolve any complaints regarding the transfer of your data that we 
cannot resolve with you directly.</p>
<h2>European requirements</h2>
<p>If European Union (EU) data protection law applies to the processing 
of your information, we provide the controls described in this policy so
 you can exercise your right to request access to, update, remove, and 
restrict the processing of your information. You also have the right to 
object to the processing of your information or export your information 
to another service.</p>
<p>For users based in the European Economic Area or Switzerland, 
the data controller responsible for your information is Google Ireland 
Limited, unless otherwise stated in a service-specific privacy notice. 
In other words, Google Ireland Limited is the Google affiliate that is 
responsible for processing your information and for complying with 
applicable privacy laws.</p>
<p>We process your information for the purposes described in this policy, based on the following legal grounds:</p>
<h3>With your consent</h3>

    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="footnote-useful-ads">ads you’ll find most useful</h3>
<p>For example, if you watch videos about baking on YouTube, you may see
 more ads that relate to baking as you browse the web. We also may use 
your IP address to determine your approximate location, so that we can 
serve you ads for a nearby pizza delivery service if you search for 
“pizza.” Learn more <a href="https://support.google.com/accounts?p=privpol_whyad">about Google ads</a> and <a href="https://support.google.com/accounts?p=privpol_whyad">why you may see particular ads</a>.</p>
<h3 id="footnote-people-online">the people who matter most to you online</h3>
<p>For example, when you type an address in the To, Cc, or Bcc field of 
an email you're composing, Gmail will suggest addresses based on the 
people you <a href="https://contacts.google.com/">contact most frequently</a>.</p>
<h3 id="footnote-phone-number">phone number</h3>
<p>If you add your phone number to your account, it can be used for 
different purposes across Google services, depending on your settings. 
For example, your phone number can be used to help you access your 
account if you forget your password, help people find and connect with 
you, and make the ads you see more relevant to you. <a href="https://support.google.com/accounts?p=privpol_phone&amp;hl=en">Learn more</a></p>
<h3 id="footnote-payment-info">payment information</h3>
<p>For example, if you add a credit card or other payment method to your
 Google Account, you can use it to buy things across our services, like 
apps in the Play Store. We may also ask for other information, like a 
business tax ID, to help process your payment. In some cases, we may 
also need to verify your identity and may ask you for information to do 
this.</p>
<p>We may also use payment information to verify that you meet age 
requirements, if, for example, you enter an incorrect birthday 
indicating you’re not old enough to have a Google Account. <a href="https://support.google.com/accounts?p=privpol_agereq&amp;hl=en">Learn more</a></p>
<h3 id="footnote-devices">devices</h3>
<p>For example, we can use information from your devices to help you 
decide which device you’d like to use to install an app or view a movie 
you buy from Google Play. We also use this information to help protect 
your account.</p>
<h3 id="footnote-android-device">Android device with Google apps</h3>
<p>Android devices with Google apps include devices sold by Google or 
one of our partners and include phones, cameras, vehicles, wearables, 
and televisions. These devices use Google Play Services and other 
pre-installed apps that include services like Gmail, Maps, your phone’s 
camera and phone dialer, text-to-speech conversion, keyboard input, and 
security features.</p>
<h3 id="footnote-content-views">Views and interactions with content and ads</h3>
<p>For example, we collect information about views and interactions with
 ads so we can provide aggregated reports to advertisers, like telling 
them whether we served their ad on a page and whether the ad was likely 
seen by a viewer. We may also measure other interactions, such as how 
you move your mouse over an ad or if you interact with the page on which
 the ad appears.</p>
<h3 id="footnote-chrome-sync">synced with your Google Account</h3>
<p>Your Chrome browsing history is only saved to your account if you’ve enabled Chrome synchronization with your Google Account. <a href="https://support.google.com/chrome?p=privpol_chrsync">Learn more</a></p>
<h3 id="footnote-calls-messages">services to make and receive calls or send and receive messages</h3>
<p>Examples of these services include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Google Hangouts, for making domestic and international calls</li>
  <li>Google Voice, for making calls, sending text messages, and managing voicemail</li>
  <li>Google Fi, for a phone plan</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="footnote-sensor-data">Sensor data from your device</h3>
<p>Your device may have sensors that can be used to better understand 
your location and movement. For example, an accelerometer can be used to
 determine your speed and a gyroscope to figure out your direction of 
travel.</p>
<h3 id="footnote-near-device">Information about things near your device</h3>
<p>If you use Google’s Location services on Android, we can improve the 
performance of apps that rely on your location, like Google Maps. If you
 use Google’s Location services, your device sends information to Google
 about its location, sensors (like accelerometer), and nearby cell 
towers and Wi-Fi access points (like MAC address and signal strength). 
All these things help to determine your location. You can use your 
device settings to enable Google Location services. <a href="https://support.google.com/accounts?p=privpol_androidloc&amp;hl=en">Learn more</a></p>
<h3 id="footnote-sources">publicly accessible sources</h3>
<p>For example, we may collect information that’s publicly available 
online or from other public sources to help train Google’s language 
models and build features like Google Translate.</p>
<h3 id="footnote-against-abuse">protect against abuse</h3>
<p>For example, information about security threats can help us notify 
you if we think your account has been compromised (at which point we can
 help you take steps to protect your account).</p>
<h3 id="footnote-ad-services">advertising and research services on their behalf</h3>
<p>For example, advertisers may upload data from their loyalty-card 
programs so that they can better understand the performance of their ad 
campaigns. We only provide aggregated reports to advertisers that don’t 
reveal information about individual people.</p>
<h3 id="footnote-deliver-services">deliver our services</h3>
<p>Examples of how we use your information to deliver our services include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>We use the IP address assigned to your device to send you the data you requested, such as loading a YouTube video</li>
  <li>We use unique identifiers stored in cookies on your device to help
 us authenticate you as the person who should have access to your Google
 Account</li>
  <li>Photos and videos you upload to Google Photos are used to help you
 create albums, animations, and other creations that you can share. <a href="https://support.google.com/photos?p=privpol_manage">Learn more</a>
  </li>
  <li>A flight confirmation email you receive may be used to create a “check-in” button that appears in your Gmail</li>
  <li>When you purchase services or physical goods from us, you may
 provide us information like your shipping address or delivery 
instructions. We use this information for things like processing, 
fulfilling, and delivering your order, and to provide support in 
connection with the product or service you purchase.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="footnote-ensure-working">ensure our services are working as intended</h3>
<p>For example, we continuously monitor our systems to look for 
problems. And if we find something wrong with a specific feature, 
reviewing activity information collected before the problem started 
allows us to fix things more quickly.</p>
<h3 id="footnote-make-improvements">make improvements</h3>
<p>For example, we use cookies to analyze how people interact with our 
services. And that analysis can help us build better products. For 
example, it may help us discover that it’s taking people too long to 
complete a certain task or that they have trouble finishing steps at 
all. We can then redesign that feature and improve the product for 
everyone.</p>
<h3 id="footnote-customized-search">customized search results</h3>
<p>For example, when you’re signed in to your Google Account and have 
the Web &amp; App Activity control enabled, you can get more relevant 
search results that are based on your previous searches and activity 
from other Google services. You can <a href="https://support.google.com/websearch?p=privpol_searchactivity">learn more here</a>.
 You may also get customized search results even when you’re signed out.
 If you don’t want this level of search customization, you can <a href="https://support.google.com/websearch?p=privpol_incognito">search and browse privately</a> or turn off <a href="https://www.google.com/history/optout">signed-out search personalization</a>.</p>
<h3 id="footnote-personalized-ads">personalized ads</h3>
<p>You may also see personalized ads based on information from the 
advertiser. If you shopped on an advertiser's website, for example, they
 can use that visit information to show you ads. <a href="https://support.google.com/accounts?p=privpol_whyad&amp;hl=en">Learn more</a></p>
<h3 id="footnote-sensitive-categories">sensitive categories</h3>
<p>When showing you personalized ads, we use topics that we think might 
be of interest to you based on your activity. For example, you may see 
ads for things like "Cooking and Recipes" or "Air Travel.” We don’t use 
topics or show personalized ads based on sensitive categories like race,
 religion, sexual orientation, or health. And we <a href="https://support.google.com/adwordspolicy?p=privpol_p13nad">require the same from advertisers</a> that use our services.</p>
<h3 id="footnote-link-info">may link information</h3>
<p>Google Analytics relies on first-party cookies, which means the 
cookies are set by the Google Analytics customer. Using our systems, 
data generated through Google Analytics can be linked by the Google 
Analytics customer and by Google to third-party cookies that are related
 to visits to other websites. For example, an advertiser may want to use
 its Google Analytics data to create more relevant ads, or to further 
analyze its traffic. <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics?p=privpol_data&amp;hl=en">Learn more</a></p>
<h3 id="footnote-safety-reliability">safety and reliability</h3>
<p>Some examples of how we use your information to help keep our services safe and reliable include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Collecting and analyzing IP addresses and cookie data to protect 
against automated abuse. This abuse takes many forms, such as sending 
spam to Gmail users, stealing money from advertisers by fraudulently 
clicking on ads, or censoring content by launching a Distributed Denial 
of Service (DDoS) attack.</li>
  <li>The “last account activity” feature in Gmail can help you find out
 if and when someone accessed your email without your knowledge. This 
feature shows you information about recent activity in Gmail, such as 
the IP addresses that accessed your mail, the associated location, and 
the date and time of access. <a href="https://support.google.com/mail?p=privpol_signinactivity&amp;hl=en">Learn more</a>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="footnote-detect-abuse">detect abuse</h3>
<p>When we detect spam, malware, illegal content, and other forms of 
abuse on our systems in violation of our policies, we may disable your 
account or take other appropriate action. In certain circumstances, we 
may also report the violation to appropriate authorities.</p>
<h3 id="footnote-combine-info">combine the information we collect</h3>
<p>Some examples of how we combine the information we collect include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>When you’re signed in to your Google Account and search on Google,
 you can see search results from the public web, along with relevant 
information from the content you have in other Google products, like 
Gmail or Google Calendar. This can include things like the status of 
your upcoming flights, restaurant, and hotel reservations, or your 
photos. <a href="https://support.google.com/websearch?p=privpol_privresults&amp;hl=en">Learn more</a>
  </li>
  <li>If you have communicated with someone via Gmail and want to add 
them to a Google Doc or an event in Google Calendar, Google makes it 
easy to do so by autocompleting their email address when you start to 
type in their name. This feature makes it easier to share things with 
people you know. <a href="https://support.google.com/accounts?p=autocontacts&amp;hl=en">Learn more</a>
  </li>
  <li>The Google app can use data that you have stored in other Google 
products to show you personalized content, depending on your settings. 
For example, if you have searches stored in your Web &amp; App Activity,
 the Google app can show you news articles and other information about 
your interests, like sports scores, based your activity. <a href="https://support.google.com/websearch?p=privpol_feed&amp;hl=en">Learn more</a>
  </li>
  <li>If you link your Google Account to your Google Home, you can 
manage your information and get things done through the Google 
Assistant. For example, you can add events to your Google Calendar or 
get your schedule for the day, ask for status updates on your upcoming 
flight, or send information like driving directions to your phone. <a href="https://support.google.com/googlehome?p=privpol_actions&amp;hl=en">Learn more</a>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="footnote-other-sites">your activity on other sites and apps</h3>
<p>This activity might come from your use of Google services, like from 
syncing your account with Chrome or your visits to sites and apps that 
partner with Google. Many websites and apps partner with Google to 
improve their content and services. For example, a website might use our
 advertising services (like AdSense) or analytics tools (like Google 
Analytics), or it might embed other content (such as videos from 
YouTube). These services may share information about your activity with 
Google and, depending on your <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/">account settings</a>
 and the products in use (for instance, when a partner uses Google 
Analytics in conjunction with our advertising services), this data may 
be associated with your personal information.</p>
<p><a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites">Learn more</a> about how Google uses data when you use our partners' sites or apps.</p>
<h3 id="footnote-partner">partner with Google</h3>
<p>There are over 2 million non-Google websites and apps that partner with Google to show ads. <a href="https://support.google.com/accounts?p=privpol_controlads&amp;hl=en">Learn more</a></p>
<h3 id="footnote-delete-specific">specific Google services</h3>
<p>For example, you can delete <a href="https://support.google.com/blogger?p=privpol_blog">your blog</a> from Blogger or <a href="https://support.google.com/sites?p=privpol_delete">a Google Site you own</a> from Google Sites. You can also delete <a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay?p=privpol_review">reviews</a> you’ve left on apps, games, and other content in the Play Store.</p>
<h3 id="footnote-rely-on-cookies">rely on cookies to function properly</h3>
<p>For example, we use a cookie called ‘lbcs’ that makes it possible for
 you to open many Google Docs in one browser. Blocking this cookie would
 prevent Google Docs from working as expected. <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/types">Learn more</a></p>
<h3 id="footnote-legal">legal process, or enforceable governmental request</h3>
<p>Like other technology and communications companies, Google regularly 
receives requests from governments and courts around the world to 
disclose user data. Respect for the privacy and security of data you 
store with Google underpins our approach to complying with these legal 
requests. Our legal team reviews each and every request, regardless of 
type, and we frequently push back when a request appears to be overly 
broad or doesn’t follow the correct process. Learn more in our <a href="https://transparencyreport.google.com/user-data/overview">Transparency Report</a>.</p>
<h3 id="footnote-trends">show trends</h3>
<p>When lots of people start searching for something, it can provide 
useful information about particular trends at that time. Google Trends 
samples Google web searches to estimate the popularity of searches over a

<h3 id="footnote-browser-storage">Browser web storage</h3>
<p>Browser web storage enables websites to store data in a browser on a 
device. When used in "local storage" mode, it enables data to be stored 
across sessions. This makes data retrievable even after a browser has 
been closed and reopened. One technology that facilitates web storage is
 HTML 5.</p>
<h3 id="footnote-cookies-and-similar-technologies">Cookies and similar technologies</h3>
<p>A cookie is a small file containing a string of characters that is 
sent to your computer when you visit a website. When you visit the site 
again, the cookie allows that site to recognize your browser. Cookies 
may store user preferences and other information. You can configure your
 browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being 
sent. However, some website features or services may not function 
properly without cookies. Learn more about <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/cookies">how Google uses cookies</a> and how Google uses data, including cookies, <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites">when you use our partners' sites or apps</a>.</p>
<h3 id="footnote-device">Device</h3>

<h3 id="footnote-info">Non-personally identifiable information</h3>
<p>This is information that is recorded about users so that it no longer reflects or references an individually-identifiable user.</p>
<h3 id="footnote-ip">IP address</h3>
<p>Every device connected to the Internet is assigned a number known as 
an Internet protocol (IP) address. These numbers are usually assigned in
 geographic blocks. An IP address can often be used to identify the 
location from which a device is connecting to the Internet.</p>
<h3 id="footnote-pixel">Pixel tag</h3>

<p>This is information that you provide to us which personally 
identifies you, such as your name, email address, or billing 
information, or other data that can be reasonably linked to such 
information by Google, such as information we associate with your Google
 Account.</p>
<h3 id="footnote-sensitive-info">Sensitive personal information</h3>
<p>This is a particular category of personal information relating to 
topics such as confidential medical facts, racial or ethnic origins, 
political or religious beliefs, or sexuality.</p>
<h3 id="footnote-server-logs">Server logs</h3>
<p>Like most websites, our servers automatically record the page 
requests made when you visit our sites. These “server logs” typically 
include your web request, Internet Protocol address, browser type, 
browser language, the date and time of your request, and one or more 
cookies that may uniquely identify your browser.</p>
<p>A typical log entry for a search for “cars” looks like this:</p>
<pre>123.45.67.89 - 25/Mar/2003 10:15:32 -<br>http://www.google.com/search?q=cars -<br>Firefox 1.0.7; Windows NT 5.1 -<br>740674ce2123e969</pre>
<ul>
  <li><code>123.45.67.89</code> is the Internet Protocol address 
assigned to the user by the user’s ISP. Depending on the user’s service,
 a different address may be assigned to the user by their service 
provider each time they connect to the Internet.</li>
  <li><code>25/Mar/2003 10:15:32</code> is the date and time of the query.</li>
  <li><code>http://www.google.com/search?q=cars</code> is the requested URL, including the search query.</li>
  <li><code>Firefox 1.0.7; Windows NT 5.1</code> is the browser and operating system being used.</li>
  <li><code>740674ce2123a969</code> is the unique cookie ID assigned to 
this particular computer the first time it visited Google. (Cookies can 
be deleted by users. If the user has deleted the cookie from the 
computer since the last time they’ve visited Google, then it will be the
 unique cookie ID assigned to their device the next time they visit 
Google from that particular device).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="footnote-unique-id">Unique identifiers</h3>
<p>A unique identifier is a string of characters that can be used to 
uniquely identify a browser, app, or device. Different identifiers vary 
in how permanent they are, whether they can be reset by users, and how 
they can be accessed.</p>
<p>Unique identifiers can be used for various purposes, including 
security and fraud detection, syncing services such as your email inbox,
 remembering your preferences, and providing personalized advertising. 
For example, unique identifiers stored in cookies help sites display 
content in your browser in your preferred language. You can configure 
your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being
 sent. Learn more about <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/cookies">how Google uses cookies</a>.</p>
<p>On other platforms besides browsers, unique identifiers are used to 
recognize a specific device or app on that device. For example, a unique
 identifier such as the Advertising ID is used to provide relevant 
advertising on Android devices, and can be <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads">managed</a>
 in your device’s settings. Unique identifiers may also be incorporated 
into a device by its manufacturer (sometimes called a universally unique
 ID or UUID), such as the IMEI-number of a mobile phone. For example, a 
device’s unique identifier can be used to customize our service to your 
device or analyze device issues related to our services.</p>
