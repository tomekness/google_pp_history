<h3 id="information">Information we collect and how we use it</h3>
<p>We offer a number of services that do not require you to register for
 an account or provide any personal information to us, such as Google 
Search. In order to provide our full range of services, we may collect 
the following types of information:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Information you provide</strong> – When you sign up for a <a href="https://www.google.com/privacy_faq.html#account">Google Account</a>
 or other Google service or promotion that requires registration, we ask
 you for personal information (such as your name, email address and an 
account password). For certain services, such as our advertising 
programs, we also request credit card or other payment account 
information which we maintain in encrypted form on secure servers. We 
may combine the information you submit under your account with 
information from other Google services or third parties in order to 
provide you with a better experience and to improve the quality of our 
services. For certain services, we may give you the opportunity to opt 
out of combining such information.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Cookies</strong> – When you visit Google, we send one or 
more cookies – a small file containing a string of characters – to your 
computer that uniquely identifies your browser. We use cookies to 
improve the quality of our service by storing user preferences and 
tracking user trends, such as how people search. Google also uses 
cookies in its advertising services to help advertisers and publishers 
serve and manage ads across the web. We may set a cookie in your browser
 when you visit a website and view or click on an ad supported by 
Google’s advertising services.</li>
  <li>
    <strong>Log information</strong> – When you access Google services, 
our servers automatically record information that your browser sends 
whenever you visit a website. These <a href="https://www.google.com/privacy_faq.html#serverlogs">server logs</a>
 may include information such as your web request, Internet Protocol 
address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your 
request and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser.
  </li>
  <li><strong>User communications</strong> – When you send email or 
other communications to Google, we may retain those communications in 
order to process your inquiries, respond to your requests and improve 
our services.</li>
  <li><strong>Affiliated sites</strong> – We offer some of our services 
in connection with other web sites. Personal information that you 
provide to those sites may be sent to Google in order to deliver the 
service. We process such information in accordance with this Privacy 
Policy. The affiliated sites may have different privacy practices and we
 encourage you to read their privacy policies.</li>
  <li>
    <strong>Links</strong> – Google may present links in a format that 
enables us to keep track of whether these links have been followed. We 
use this information to improve the quality of our search technology, 
customized content and advertising. For more information about links and
 redirected URLs, please see our <a href="https://www.google.com/privacy_faq.html#urls">FAQs</a>.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Other sites</strong> – This Privacy Policy applies to 
Google services only. We do not exercise control over the sites 
displayed as search results or links from within our various services. 
These other sites may place their own cookies or other files on your 
computer, collect data or solicit personal information from you.</li>
</ul>
<p>Google only processes personal information for the purposes described
 in this Privacy Policy and/or the supplementary privacy notices for 
specific services. In addition to the above, such purposes include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Providing our services to users, including the display of customized content and advertising;</li>
  <li>Auditing, research and analysis in order to maintain, protect and improve our services;</li>
  <li>Ensuring the technical functioning of our network; and</li>
  <li>Developing new services.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can find more information about how we process personal 
information by referring to the supplementary privacy notices for 
particular services.</p>
<p>Google processes personal information on our servers in the United 
States of America and in other countries. In some cases, we process 
personal information on a server outside your own country. We may 
process personal information to provide our own services. In some cases,
 we may process personal information on behalf of and according to the 
instructions of a third party, such as our advertising partners.</p>
<h3 id="infochoices">Choices for personal information</h3>
<p>When you sign up for a particular service that requires registration,
 we ask you to provide personal information. If we use this information 
in a manner different than the purpose for which it was collected, then 
we will ask for your consent prior to such use.</p>
<p>If we propose to use personal information for any purposes other than
 those described in this Privacy Policy and/or in the specific service 
privacy notices, we will offer you an effective way to opt out of the 
use of personal information for those other purposes. We will not 
collect or use <a href="https://www.google.com/privacy_faq.html#sensitiveinfo">sensitive information</a>
 for purposes other than those described in this Privacy Policy and/or 
in the supplementary service privacy notices, unless we have obtained 
your prior consent.</p>
<p>Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can 
reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is
 being sent. However, some Google features and services may not function
 properly if your cookies are disabled.</p>
<p>You may choose to <a href="https://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html">opt out of Google’s Ad Serving cookies</a> on the <a href="https://adwords.google.com/select/afc.html">Google content network</a> at any time by using <a href="http://www.doubleclick.com/privacy/dart_adserving.aspx">DoubleClick’s cookie opt-out</a>.</p>
<p>You can decline to submit personal information to any of our 
services, in which case Google may not be able to provide those services
 to you.</p>
<h3 id="infosharing">Information sharing</h3>
<p>Google only shares personal information with other companies or 
individuals outside of Google in the following limited circumstances:</p>
<ul>
  <li>We have your consent. We require opt-in consent for the sharing of any sensitive personal information.</li>
  <li>We provide such information to our subsidiaries, affiliated 
companies or other trusted businesses or persons for the purpose of 
processing personal information on our behalf. We require that these 
parties agree to process such information based on our instructions and 
in compliance with this Privacy Policy and any other appropriate 
confidentiality and security measures.</li>
  <li>We have a good faith belief that access, use, preservation or 
disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary to (a) satisfy 
any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable 
governmental request, (b) enforce applicable Terms of Service, including
 investigation of potential violations thereof, (c) detect, prevent, or 
otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, or (d) protect 
against imminent harm to the rights, property or safety of Google, its 
users or the public as required or permitted by law.</li>
</ul>
<p>If Google becomes involved in a merger, acquisition, or any form of 
sale of some or all of its assets, we will provide notice before 
personal information is transferred and becomes subject to a different 
privacy policy.</p>
<p>We may share with third parties certain pieces of <a href="https://www.google.com/privacy_faq.html#aggregatedinfo">aggregated, non-personal information</a>,
 such as the number of users who searched for a particular term, for 
example, or how many users clicked on a particular advertisement. Such 
information does not identify you individually.</p>
<p>Please contact us at the address below for any additional questions about the management or use of personal data.</p>
<h3 id="infosecurity">Information security</h3>
<p>We take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized
 access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of 
data. These include internal reviews of our data collection, storage and
 processing practices and security measures, as well as physical 
security measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems where 
we store personal data.</p>
<p>We restrict access to personal information to Google employees, 
contractors and agents who need to know that information in order to 
operate, develop or improve our services. These individuals are bound by
 confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline, including
 termination and criminal prosecution, if they fail to meet these 
obligations.</p>
<h3 id="dataintegrity">Data integrity</h3>
<p>Google processes personal information only for the purposes for which
 it was collected and in accordance with this Privacy Policy or any 
applicable service-specific privacy notice. We review our data 
collection, storage and processing practices to ensure that we only 
collect, store and process the personal information needed to provide or
 improve our services. We take reasonable steps to ensure that the 
personal information we process is accurate, complete, and current, but 
we depend on our users to update or correct their personal information 
whenever necessary.</p>
<h3 id="access">Accessing and updating personal information</h3>
<p>When you use Google services, we make good faith efforts to provide 
you with access to your personal information and either to correct this 
data if it is inaccurate or to delete such data at your request if it is
 not otherwise required to be retained by law or for legitimate business
 purposes. We ask individual users to identify themselves and the 
information requested to be accessed, corrected or removed before 
processing such requests, and we may decline to process requests that 
are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate 
technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, or would be 
extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information 
residing on backup tapes), or for which access is not otherwise 
required. In any case where we provide information access and 
correction, we perform this service free of charge, except if doing so 
would require a disproportionate effort. Some of our services have 
different procedures to access, correct or delete users’ personal 
information. We provide the details for these procedures in the specific
 privacy notices or FAQs for these services.</p>
<h3 id="enforcement">Enforcement</h3>
<p>Google regularly reviews its compliance with this Privacy Policy.
