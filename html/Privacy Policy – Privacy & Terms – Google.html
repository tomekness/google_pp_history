<h3 id="information">Information we collect and how we use it</h3>
<p>We may collect the following types of information:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Information you provide</strong> – When you sign up for a <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/privacy/faq.html#toc-terms-account">Google Account</a>, we ask you for <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/privacy/faq.html#toc-terms-personal-info">personal information</a>.
 We may combine the information you submit under your account with 
information from other Google services or third parties in order to 
provide you with a better experience and to improve the quality of our 
services. For certain services, we may give you the opportunity to opt 
out of combining such information. You can use the Google Dashboard to 
learn more about the information associated with your Account. If you 
are using Google services in conjunction with your Google Apps Account, 
Google provides such services in conjunction with or on behalf of <a href="https://www.google.com/support/a/bin/answer.py?answer=178897">your domain administrator</a>.
 Your administrator will have access to your account information 
including your email. Consult your domain administrator’s privacy policy
 for more information.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Cookies</strong> – When you visit Google, we send one or more <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/privacy/faq.html#toc-terms-cookie">cookies</a>
 to your computer or other device. We use cookies to improve the quality
 of our service, including for storing user preferences, improving 
search results and ad selection, and tracking user trends, such as how 
people search. Google also uses cookies in its advertising services to 
help advertisers and publishers serve and manage ads across the web and 
on Google services.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Log information</strong> – When you access Google services 
via a browser, application or other client our servers automatically 
record certain information. These <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/privacy/faq.html#toc-terms-server-logs">server logs</a>
 may include information such as your web request, your interaction with
 a service, Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, 
the date and time of your request and one or more cookies that may 
uniquely identify your browser or your account.
  </li>
  <li><strong>User communications</strong> – When you send email or 
other communications to Google, we may retain those communications in 
order to process your inquiries, respond to your requests and improve 
our services. When you send and receive SMS messages to or from one of 
our services that provides SMS functionality, we may collect and 
maintain information associated with those messages, such as the phone 
number, the wireless carrier associated with the phone number, the 
content of the message, and the date and time of the transaction. We may
 use your email address to communicate with you about our services.</li>
  <li><strong>Affiliated Google Services on other sites</strong> – We 
offer some of our services on or through other web sites. Personal 
information that you provide to those sites may be sent to Google in 
order to deliver the service. We process such information under this 
Privacy Policy.</li>
  <li><strong>Third Party Applications</strong> – Google may make 
available third party applications, such as gadgets or extensions, 
through its services. The information collected by Google when you 
enable a third party application is processed under this Privacy 
Policy.&nbsp;Information collected by the third party application 
provider is governed by their privacy policies.</li>
  <li><strong>Location data</strong> – Google offers location-enabled 
services, such as Google Maps and Latitude. If you use those services, 
Google may receive information about your actual location (such as GPS 
signals sent by a mobile device) or information that can be used to 
approximate a location (such as a cell ID).</li>
  <li><strong>Unique application number</strong> – Certain services, 
such as Google Toolbar, include a unique application number that is not 
associated with your account or you. This number and information about 
your installation (e.g., operating system type, version number) may be 
sent to Google when you install or uninstall that service or when that 
service periodically contacts our servers (for example, to request 
automatic updates to the software).</li>
  <li><strong>Other sites</strong> – This Privacy Policy applies to 
Google services only. We do not exercise control over the sites 
displayed as search results, sites that include Google applications, 
products or services, or links from within our various services. These 
other sites may place their own cookies or other files on your computer,
 collect data or solicit personal information from you.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to the above, we may use the information we collect to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Provide, maintain, protect, and improve our services (including advertising services) and develop new services; and</li>
  <li>Protect the rights or property of Google or our users.</li>
</ul>
<p>If we use this information in a manner different than the purpose for
 which it was collected, then we will ask for your consent prior to such
 use.</p>
<p>Google processes personal information on our servers in the United 
States of America and in other countries. In some cases, we process 
personal information outside your own country.</p>
<h3 id="infochoices">Choices</h3>
<p>You can use the <a href="https://www.google.com/dashboard/?hl=en">Google Dashboard</a> to review and control the information stored in your Google Account.</p>
<p>Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can 
reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is
 being sent. However, some Google features and services may not function
 properly if your cookies are disabled.</p>
<p>Google uses the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.doubleclick.com/privacy/dart_adserving.aspx">DoubleClick advertising cookie</a>
 on AdSense partner sites and certain Google services to help 
advertisers and publishers serve and manage ads across the web. You can 
view and manage your ads preferences associated with this cookie by 
accessing the <a href="https://www.google.com/ads/preferences/?hl=en">Ads Preferences Manager</a>. In addition, you may choose to opt out of the DoubleClick cookie at any time by using <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/privacy/ads/">DoubleClick’s opt-out cookie</a>.</p>
<h3 id="infosharing">Information sharing</h3>
<p>Google only shares personal information with other companies or 
individuals outside of Google in the following limited circumstances:</p>
<ul>
  <li>We have your consent. We require opt-in consent for the sharing of any sensitive personal information.</li>
  <li>We provide such information to our subsidiaries, affiliated 
companies or other trusted businesses or persons for the purpose of 
processing personal information on our behalf. We require that these 
parties agree to process such information based on our instructions and 
in compliance with this Privacy Policy and any other appropriate 
confidentiality and security measures.</li>
  <li>We have a good faith belief that access, use, preservation or 
disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary to (a) satisfy 
any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable 
governmental request, (b) enforce applicable Terms of Service, including
 investigation of potential violations thereof, (c) detect, prevent, or 
otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, or (d) protect 
against harm to the rights, property or safety of Google, its users or 
the public as required or permitted by law.</li>
</ul>
<p>If Google becomes involved in a merger, acquisition, or any form of 
sale of some or all of its assets, we will ensure the confidentiality of
 any personal information involved in such transactions and provide 
notice before personal information is transferred and becomes subject to
 a different privacy policy.</p>
<h3 id="infosecurity">Information security</h3>
<p>We take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized
 access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of 
data. These include internal reviews of our data collection, storage and
 processing practices and security measures, including appropriate 
encryption and physical security measures to guard against unauthorized 
access to systems where we store personal data.</p>
<p>We restrict access to personal information to Google employees, 
contractors and agents who need to know that information in order to 
process it on our behalf. These individuals are bound by confidentiality
 obligations and may be subject to discipline, including termination and
 criminal prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations.</p>
<h3 id="access">Accessing and updating personal information</h3>
<p>When you use Google services, we make good faith efforts to provide 
you with access to your personal information and either to correct this 
data if it is inaccurate or to delete such data at your request if it is
 not otherwise required to be retained by law or for legitimate business
 purposes. We ask individual users to identify themselves and the 
information requested to be accessed, corrected or removed before 
processing such requests, and we may decline to process requests that 
are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate 
technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, or would be 
extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information 
residing on backup tapes), or for which access is not otherwise 
required. In any case where we provide information access and 
correction, we perform this service free of charge, except if doing so 
would require a disproportionate effort. Because of the way we maintain 
certain services, after you delete your information, residual copies may
 take a period of time before they are deleted from our active servers 
and may remain in our backup systems. Please review the service Help 
Centers for more information.</p>
<h3 id="enforcement">Enforcement</h3>
<p>Google adheres to the US Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of Notice, 
Choice, Onward Transfer, Security, Data Integrity, Access and 
Enforcement, and is registered with the <a href="http://export.gov/safeharbor/">U.S. Department of Commerce’s Safe Harbor Program</a>.</p>
<p>Google regularly reviews its compliance with this Privacy Policy. 
When we receive formal written complaints, it is Google’s policy to 
contact the complaining user regarding his or her concerns. We will 
cooperate with the appropriate regulatory authorities, including local 
data protection authorities, to resolve any complaints regarding the 
transfer of personal data that cannot be resolved between Google and an 
individual.</p>
<h3 id="policychanges">Changes to this Privacy Policy</h3>
<p>Please note that this Privacy Policy may change from time to time. We
 will not reduce your rights under this Privacy Policy without your 
explicit consent. We will post any Privacy Policy changes on this page 
and, if the changes are significant, we will provide a more prominent 
notice (including, for certain services, email notification of Privacy 
Policy changes). We will also keep <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/privacy/archive/">prior versions</a> of this Privacy Policy in an archive for your review.</p>
