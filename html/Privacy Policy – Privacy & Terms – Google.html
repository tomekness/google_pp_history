<p>At Google, we strive to develop innovative services to better serve 
our users. We recognize that privacy is an important issue, so we design
 and operate our services with the protection of your privacy in mind. 
This Privacy Policy outlines the types of personal information we gather
 when you use Google’s services, as well as some of the steps we take to
 safeguard it.</p>
<p>The following principles apply to the personally identifying 
information we ask for and that you provide. “Personally identifying 
information” is information that individually identifies you, such as 
your name, physical address or email address. You can find more details 
about the data we collect on particular services by clicking the links 
on the side of this page.</p>
<h2>Data collection</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Google search, the Google Toolbar, Google News and some other services do not require any personally identifying information.</li>
  <li>Google collects limited non-personally identifying information 
your browser makes available whenever you visit a website. This log 
information includes your Internet Protocol address, browser type, 
browser language, the date and time of your query and one or more 
cookies that may uniquely identify your browser. We use this information
 to operate, develop and improve our services.</li>
  <li>Some of our services require you to register for an account. 
Google asks you for some personal information in order to create an 
account (typically your name, email address and a password for your 
account) and we will use that information to provide the service. For 
certain services, such as our advertising programs, we may request 
credit card or other payment information which we maintain in encrypted 
form on secure servers.</li>
  <li>When we require personally identifying information, we will inform
 you about the types of information we collect and how we use it. We 
hope this will help you make an informed decision about sharing your 
personal information with us.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Cookies</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Upon your first visit to Google, a cookie is sent to your computer
 that uniquely identifies your browser. A “cookie” is a small file 
containing a string of characters that is sent to your computer when you
 visit a website. We use cookies to improve the quality of our service 
and to better understand how people interact with us. Google does this 
by storing user preferences in cookies and by tracking user trends and 
patterns of how people search. Most browsers are initially set up to 
accept cookies. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to 
indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some Google features or 
services may not function properly without cookies.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Information sharing</h2>
<ul>
  <li>We do not rent or sell your personally identifying information to 
other companies or individuals, unless we have your consent. We may 
share such information in any of the following limited circumstances:
    <ul>
      <li>We have your consent.</li>
      <li>We provide such information to trusted businesses or persons 
for the sole purpose of processing personally identifying information on
 our behalf. When this is done, it is subject to agreements that oblige 
those parties to process such information only on our instructions and 
in compliance with this Privacy Policy and appropriate confidentiality 
and security measures.</li>
      <li>We conclude that we are required by law or have a good faith 
belief that access, preservation or disclosure of such information is 
reasonably necessary to protect the rights, property or safety of 
Google, its users or the public.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>If you have an account, we may share the information submitted 
under your account among all of our services in order to provide you 
with a seamless experience and to improve the quality of our services. 
We will not disclose your account information to other people or 
non-affiliated companies, except in the limited circumstances described 
in this Policy or with your consent.</li>
  <li>We may store and process personal information collected on our 
site in the United States or any other country in which Google Inc. or 
its agents maintain facilities. By using our services, you consent to 
the transfer of your information among these facilities, including those
 located outside your country.</li>
  <li>In the event of a transfer of ownership of Google Inc., such as 
acquisition by or merger with another company, we will provide notice 
before any personally identifying information is transferred and becomes
 subject to a different privacy policy.</li>
  <li>We may share aggregated information with others. Examples of this 
include the number of users who searched for “Mars Rover” or how many 
users clicked on a particular advertisement.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Information security</h2>
<ul>
  <li>We take appropriate security measures to protect against 
unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or 
destruction of data.</li>
  <li>We restrict access to your personally identifying information to 
employees who need to know that information in order to operate, develop
 or improve our services.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Updating your information</h2>
<ul>
  <li>We provide mechanisms for updating and correcting your personally 
identifying information for many of our services. For more information, 
please see the help pages for each service.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Links</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The sites displayed as search results or linked to by Google’s 
services are developed by people over whom Google exercises no control. 
These other sites may place their own cookies on your computer, collect 
data or solicit personal information.</li>
  <li>Google may present links in a format that enables us to understand
 whether they have been followed. We use this information to understand 
and improve the quality of Google’s search technology. For instance, 
this data helps us determine how often users are satisfied with the 
first result of a query and how often they proceed to later results.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Changes to this Policy</h2>
<p>Please note this Privacy Policy will change from time to time. We 
expect most such changes to be minor, but there may be changes that are 
more significant. Regardless, we will post those changes on this page 
and, if the changes are significant, we will also provide a more 
prominent notice. Each version will be noted at the top of the page. <a href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/archive/">Prior versions of this Privacy Policy</a> will be kept in an archive for you to view.</p>
<p>If you have any additional questions, please feel free to <a href="https://support.google.com/policies/troubleshooter/2990837?hl=en">contact us any time</a>.</p>
