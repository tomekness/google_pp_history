<h2>Google’s Policy</h2>
<p>Google’s policy on our wholly controlled and operated Internet sites 
is to respect and protect the privacy of our users. Google does not 
willfully disclose individually identifiable information about its 
customers to any third party without first receiving that customer’s 
permission. This policy statement tells you how we collect information 
from you and how we use it.</p>
<p>Google may share information about users with advertisers, business partners, sponsors, and other third parties. However, we <b>only</b>
 talk about our users in aggregate, not as individuals. For example, we 
may disclose how frequently the average Google user visits Google, or 
which other query words are most often used with the query word 
“Microsoft.”</p>
<p>From time to time, there may be situations where Google asks you for 
personal information. When we intend to use your personal information, 
we tell you up front. This way you can decide whether you want to give 
us the information or not. In case you change your mind or some personal
 information changes, we will endeavor to provide a way to correct, 
update or remove the personal data you give us.</p>
<h2>Google and Cookies</h2>
<p>Upon your first visit to Google, Google sends a “cookie” to your 
computer. A cookie is a file that identifies you as a unique user. It 
can also store personal preferences and user data. A cookie can tell us,
 “This is the same individual who visited Google two days ago” but it 
cannot tell us, “This person is Joe Smith” or even, “This person lives 
in the United States.”</p>
<p>Google uses cookies to track user trends and patterns, in order to 
better understand our user base and to improve the quality of our 
service. Google may also choose to use cookies to store user 
preferences.</p>
<p>Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. You can reset 
your browser to refuse all cookies or indicate when a cookie is being 
sent. However, note that some parts of Google may not function properly 
if you refuse cookies.</p>
<h2>Links to Other Sites</h2>
<p>The page that comes up after “clicking” on a result URL is likely to 
be outside the Google site and beyond our control. Other links, such as 
for the Google-friends mailing list archive, are also on sites not 
controlled by Google. These other sites may send their own cookies to 
users, collect data, or solicit personal information.</p>
<p>Google may choose to exhibit its search results in the form of a “URL
 redirecter.” When a URL redirecter is used, whenever you “click” on a 
URL from a search result, information about the “click” is sent to 
Google, which then sends you to the site you clicked on.</p>
<p>Google uses this URL information to understand and improve the 
quality of Google’s search technology. For instance, Google uses this 
information to determine how often users are satisfied with the first 
result of a query and how often they proceed to later results.</p>
<p>Google’s policy does not extend to anything that is inherent in the 
operation of the Internet, and therefore beyond Google’s control, and is
 not to be applied in any manner contrary to applicable law or 
governmental regulation.</p>
<p>We reserve the right at our discretion to make changes to this policy
 at any time. Please check this page periodically for changes.</p>
