<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>Last modified: May 1, 2015 (<a href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/archive/">view archived versions</a>)</p>
<p>There are many different ways you can use our services – to search 
for and share information, to communicate with other people or to create
 new content. When you share information with us, for example by 
creating a <a href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/key-terms/#toc-terms-account">Google Account</a>, we can make those services even better – to show you <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy/archive/20150501?hl=en-US#summary-more-relevant-search-results">more relevant search results</a> and ads, to help you <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy/archive/20150501?hl=en-US#summary-connect-with-people">connect with people</a> or to make <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy/archive/20150501?hl=en-US#summary-sharing-with-others">sharing with others quicker and easier</a>.
 As you use our services, we want you to be clear how we’re using 
information and the ways in which you can protect your privacy.</p>
<p>Our Privacy Policy explains:</p>
<ul>
  <li>What information we collect and why we collect it.</li>
  <li>How we use that information.</li>
  <li>The choices we offer, including how to access and update information.</li>
</ul>
<p>We’ve tried to keep it as simple as possible, but if you’re not 
familiar with terms like cookies, IP addresses, pixel tags and browsers,
 then read about these <a href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/key-terms/">key terms</a>
 first. Your privacy matters to Google so whether you are new to Google 
or a long-time user, please do take the time to get to know our 
practices – and if you have any questions <a href="https://support.google.com/policies/troubleshooter/2990837?hl=en">consult this page</a>.</p>
<h2 id="infocollect">Information we collect</h2>
<p>We collect information to provide better services to all of our users
 – from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more 
complex things like which <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy/archive/20150501?hl=en-US#summary-ads-youll-find-most-useful">ads you’ll find most useful</a>, <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy/archive/20150501?hl=en-US#summary-the-people-who-matter-most">the people who matter most to you online</a>, or which YouTube videos you might like.</p>
<p>We collect information in two ways:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Information you give us.</strong> For example, many of our services require you to sign up for a Google Account. When you do, we’ll ask for <a href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/key-terms/#toc-terms-personal-info">personal information</a>, like your name, email address, telephone number or <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy/archive/20150501?hl=en-US#summary-credit-card">credit card</a>. If you want to take full advantage of the sharing features we offer, we might also ask you to create a publicly visible <a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/112783?hl=en">Google Profile</a>, which may include your name and photo.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Information we get from your use of our services.</strong> We <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy/archive/20150501?hl=en-US#summary-collect-information">collect information</a>
 about the services that you use and how you use them, like when you 
watch a video on YouTube, visit a website that uses our advertising 
services, or you <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy/archive/20150501?hl=en-US#summary-view-and-interact-with-our-ads">view and interact with our ads</a> and content. This information includes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><strong><a href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/key-terms/#toc-terms-device">Device information</a></strong></p>
        <p>We collect <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy/archive/20150501?hl=en-US#summary-device-specific-information">device-specific information</a> (such as your hardware model, operating system version, <a href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/key-terms/#toc-terms-unique-device-id">unique device identifiers</a>, and mobile network information including phone number). Google may associate your <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy/archive/20150501?hl=en-US#summary-device-identifiers">device identifiers</a> or <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy/archive/20150501?hl=en-US#summary-phone-number">phone number</a> with your Google Account.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Log information</strong></p>
        <p>When you use our services or view content provided by Google, we automatically collect and store certain information in <a href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/key-terms/#toc-terms-server-logs">server logs</a>. This includes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>details of how you used our service, such as your search queries.</li>
          <li>telephony log information like your phone number, 
calling-party number, forwarding numbers, time and date of calls, 
duration of calls, SMS routing information and types of calls.</li>
          <li>
            <a href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/key-terms/#toc-terms-ip">Internet protocol address</a>.
          </li>
          <li>device event information such as crashes, system activity,
 hardware settings, browser type, browser language, the date and time of
 your request and referral URL.</li>
          <li>cookies that may uniquely identify your browser or your Google Account.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Location information</strong></p>
        <p>When you use Google services, we <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy/archive/20150501?hl=en-US#summary-may-collect-and-process-information">may collect and process information about your actual location</a>. We use various technologies to determine location, including IP address, GPS, <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy/archive/20150501?hl=en-US#summary-sensors">and other sensors</a> that may, for example, provide Google with information on nearby devices, <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy/archive/20150501?hl=en-US#summary-wifi-access-points-and-cell-towers">Wi-Fi access points and cell towers</a>.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Unique application numbers</strong></p>
        <p>Certain services include a unique application number. This 
number and information about your installation (for example, the 
operating system type and application version number) may be sent to 
Google when you install or uninstall that service or when that service 
periodically contacts our servers, such as for automatic updates.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Local storage</strong></p>
        <p>We may collect and store information (including personal information) locally on your device using mechanisms such as <a href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/key-terms/#toc-terms-browser-web-storage">browser web storage</a> (including HTML&nbsp;5) and <a href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/key-terms/#toc-terms-application-data-cache">application data caches</a>.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Cookies and anonymous identifiers</strong></p>
        <p>We <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy/archive/20150501?hl=en-US#summary-our-partners">and our partners</a>
 use various technologies to collect and store information when you 
visit a Google service, and this may include sending one or more <a href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/key-terms/#toc-terms-cookie">cookies</a> or <a href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/key-terms/#toc-terms-identifier">anonymous identifiers</a>
 to your device. We also use cookies and anonymous identifiers when you 
interact with services we offer to our partners, such as <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy/archive/20150501?hl=en-US#summary-advertising-services">advertising services</a>
 or Google features that may appear on other sites. Our Google Analytics
 product helps businesses and site owners analyze the traffic to their 
websites and apps. When used in conjunction with our advertising 
services, such as those using the DoubleClick cookie, Google Analytics 
information is <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy/archive/20150501?hl=en-US#summary-linked-with-information-about-visits-to-multiple-sites">linked, by the Google Analytics customer or by Google, using Google technology, with information about visits to multiple sites</a>.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2 id="infouse">How we use information we collect</h2>
<p>We use the information we collect from all of our services to provide, maintain, protect and improve them, to <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy/archive/20150501?hl=en-US#summary-develop-new-ones">develop new ones</a>, and to <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy/archive/20150501?hl=en-US#summary-protect-google-and-our-users">protect Google and our users</a>. We also use this information to offer you tailored content – like giving you more relevant search results and ads.</p>
<p>We may use the name you provide for your Google Profile across all of
 the services we offer that require a Google Account. In addition, we 
may replace past names associated with your Google Account so that you 
are represented consistently across all our services. If other users 
already have your email, or other information that identifies you, we 
may show them your publicly visible Google Profile information, such as 
your name and photo.</p>
<p>If you have a Google Account, we may display your Profile name, 
Profile photo, and actions you take on Google or on third-party 
applications connected to your Google Account (such as +1’s, reviews you
 write and comments you post) in our services, including displaying in 
ads and other commercial contexts. We will respect the choices you make 
to <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy/archive/20150501?hl=en-US#summary-limit-sharing-or-visibility-settings">limit sharing or visibility settings</a> in your Google Account.</p>
<p>When you contact Google, we keep a record of your communication to 
help solve any issues you might be facing. We may use your email address
 to inform you about our services, such as letting you know about 
upcoming changes or improvements.</p>
<p>We use information collected from cookies and other technologies, like <a href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/key-terms/#toc-terms-pixel">pixel tags</a>, to <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy/archive/20150501?hl=en-US#summary-improve-your-user-experience">improve your user experience</a>
 and the overall quality of our services. One of the products we use to 
do this on our own services is Google Analytics. For example, by saving 
your language preferences, we’ll be able to have our services appear in 
the language you prefer. When showing you tailored ads, we will not 
associate a cookie or anonymous identifier with <a href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/key-terms/#toc-terms-sensitive-categories">sensitive categories</a>, such as those based on race, religion, sexual orientation or health.</p>
<p>Our automated systems analyze your content (including emails) to 
provide you personally relevant product features, such as customized 
search results, tailored advertising, and spam and malware detection.</p>
<p>We may <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy/archive/20150501?hl=en-US#summary-combine-personal-information">combine personal information from one service with information, including personal information, from other Google services</a> – for example <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy/archive/20150501?hl=en-US#summary-to-make-it-easier-to-share">to make it easier to share things with people you know</a>.
 We will not combine DoubleClick cookie information with personally 
identifiable information unless we have your opt-in consent.</p>
<p>We will ask for your consent before using information for a purpose other than those that are set out in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>Google processes personal information on our servers in many 
countries around the world. We may process your personal information on a
 server located outside the country where you live.</p>
<h2 id="infochoices">Transparency and choice</h2>
<p>People have different privacy concerns. Our goal is to be clear about
 what information we collect, so that you can make meaningful choices 
about how it is used. For example, you can:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="https://www.google.com/settings/accounthistory?hl=en">Visit your Google Account History</a>
 for settings that allow you to control the collection of personal 
information from Google services, such as Search, YouTube and Location 
History.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://www.google.com/dashboard/?hl=en">Review and control</a> certain types of information tied to your Google Account by using Google Dashboard.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://www.google.com/settings/ads/preferences?hl=en">View and edit</a>
 your preferences about the Google ads shown to you on Google and across
 the web, such as which categories might interest you, using Ads 
Settings. You can also opt out of certain Google advertising services 
here.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://support.google.com/plus/answer/1355890?hl=en">Adjust</a> how the Profile associated with your Google Account appears to others.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="http://support.google.com/plus/bin/static.py?hl=en&amp;page=guide.cs&amp;guide=1257347">Control</a> who you share information with through your Google Account.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="http://www.dataliberation.org/">Take information</a> associated with your Google Account out of many of our services.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://plus.google.com/settings/endorsements">Choose</a> whether your Profile name and Profile photo appear in shared endorsements that appear in ads.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>You may also set your browser to block all cookies, including cookies
 associated with our services, or to indicate when a cookie is being set
 by us. However, it’s important to remember that many of our services <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy/archive/20150501?hl=en-US#summary-may-not-function-properly">may not function properly</a> if your cookies are disabled. For example, we may not remember your language preferences.</p>
<h2 id="infosharing">Information you share</h2>
<p>Many of our services let you share information with others. Remember 
that when you share information publicly, it may be indexable by search 
engines, including Google. Our services provide you with different 
options on <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy/archive/20150501?hl=en-US#summary-sharing">sharing</a> and <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy/archive/20150501?hl=en-US#summary-removing-your-content">removing your content</a>.</p>
<h2 id="access">Accessing and updating your personal information</h2>
<p>Whenever you use our services, we aim to provide you with <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy/archive/20150501?hl=en-US#summary-access-to-your-personal-information">access to your personal information</a>.
 If that information is wrong, we strive to give you ways to update it 
quickly or to delete it – unless we have to keep that information for 
legitimate business or legal purposes. When updating your personal 
information, we may ask you to verify your identity before we can act on
 your request.</p>
<p>We may reject requests that are unreasonably repetitive, require 
disproportionate technical effort (for example, developing a new system 
or fundamentally changing an existing practice), risk the privacy of 
others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests 
concerning information residing on backup systems).</p>
<p>Where we can provide information access and correction, we will do so
 for free, except where it would require a disproportionate effort. We 
aim to maintain our services in a manner that protects information from 
accidental or malicious destruction. Because of this, after you delete 
information from our services, we may not immediately delete residual 
copies from our active servers and may not remove information from our 
backup systems.</p>
<h2 id="nosharing">Information we share</h2>
<p>We do not share personal information with companies, organizations 
and individuals outside of Google unless one of the following 
circumstances applies:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>With your consent</strong></p>
    <p>We will share personal information with companies, organizations 
or individuals outside of Google when we have your consent to do so. We 
require opt-in consent for the sharing of any <a href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/key-terms/#toc-terms-sensitive-info">sensitive personal information</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>With domain administrators</strong></p>
    <p>If your Google Account is managed for you by a <a href="https://support.google.com/a/answer/178897?hl=en">domain administrator</a>
 (for example, for Google Apps users) then your domain administrator and
 resellers who provide user support to your organization will have 
access to your Google Account information (including your email and 
other data). Your domain administrator may be able to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>view statistics regarding your account, like statistics regarding applications you install.</li>
      <li>change your account password.</li>
      <li>suspend or terminate your account access.</li>
      <li>access or retain information stored as part of your account.</li>
      <li>receive your account information in order to satisfy applicable law, regulation, <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy/archive/20150501?hl=en-US#summary-legal-process">legal process or enforceable governmental request</a>.
      </li>
      <li>restrict your ability to delete or edit information or privacy settings.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Please refer to your domain administrator’s privacy policy for more information.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>For external processing</strong></p>
    <p>We provide personal information to our <a href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/key-terms/#toc-terms-affiliates">affiliates</a>
 or other trusted businesses or persons to process it for us, based on 
our instructions and in compliance with our Privacy Policy and any other
 appropriate confidentiality and security measures.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>For legal reasons</strong></p>
    <p>We will share personal information with companies, organizations 
or individuals outside of Google if we have a good-faith belief that 
access, use, preservation or disclosure of the information is reasonably
 necessary to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>meet any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request.</li>
      <li>enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations.</li>
      <li>detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues.</li>
      <li>protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Google, our users or the public as required or permitted by law.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy/archive/20150501?hl=en-US#summary-we-may-share-aggregated">We may share aggregated</a>, <a href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/key-terms/#toc-terms-info">non-personally identifiable information</a>
 publicly and with our partners – like publishers, advertisers or 
connected sites. For example, we may share information publicly <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy/archive/20150501?hl=en-US#summary-to-show-trends">to show trends</a> about the general use of our services.</p>
<p>If Google is involved in a merger, acquisition or asset sale, we will
 continue to ensure the confidentiality of any personal information and 
give affected users notice before personal information is transferred or
 becomes subject to a different privacy policy.</p>
<h2 id="infosecurity">Information security</h2>
<p>We work hard to protect Google and our users from unauthorized access
 to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of information
 we hold. In particular:</p>
<ul>
  <li>We encrypt many of our services <a href="https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/173733?hl=en">using SSL</a>.
  </li>
  <li>We offer you <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/landing/2step/">two step verification</a> when you access your Google Account, and a <a href="http://www.google.com/chrome/intl/en/more/security.html">Safe Browsing feature</a> in Google Chrome.
  </li>
  <li>We review our information collection, storage and processing 
practices, including physical security measures, to guard against 
unauthorized access to systems.</li>
  <li>We restrict access to personal information to Google employees, 
contractors and agents who need to know that information in order to 
process it for us, and who are subject to strict contractual 
confidentiality obligations and may be disciplined or terminated if they
 fail to meet these obligations.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="application">When this Privacy Policy applies</h2>
<p>Our Privacy Policy applies to all of the services offered by Google 
Inc. and its affiliates, including YouTube, and services offered on 
other sites (such as our advertising services), but excludes services 
that have separate privacy policies that do not incorporate this Privacy
 Policy.</p>
<p>Our Privacy Policy does not apply to services offered by other 
companies or individuals, including products or sites that may be 
displayed to you in search results, sites that may include Google 
services, or other sites linked from our services. Our Privacy Policy 
does not cover the information practices of other companies and 
organizations who advertise our services, and who may use cookies, pixel
 tags and other technologies to serve and offer relevant ads.</p>
<h2 id="enforcement">Compliance and cooperation with regulatory authorities</h2>
<p>We regularly review our compliance with our Privacy Policy. We also adhere to several <a href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/frameworks/">self regulatory frameworks</a>.
 When we receive formal written complaints, we will contact the person 
who made the complaint to follow up. We work with the appropriate 
regulatory authorities, including local data protection authorities, to 
resolve any complaints regarding the transfer of personal data that we 
cannot resolve with our users directly.</p>
<h2 id="policychanges">Changes</h2>
<p>Our Privacy Policy may change from time to time. We will not reduce 
your rights under this Privacy Policy without your explicit consent. We 
will post any privacy policy changes on this page and, if the changes 
are significant, we will provide a more prominent notice (including, for
 certain services, email notification of privacy policy changes). We 
will also keep prior versions of this Privacy Policy in an archive for 
your review.</p>

<h2 id="summary-ads-youll-find-most-useful">"ads you’ll find most useful"</h2>
<p>For example, if you frequently visit websites and blogs about 
gardening, you may see ads related to gardening as you browse the web. <a href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/example/ads-youll-find-most-useful.html">Learn more.</a></p>
<h2 id="summary-advertising-services">"advertising services"</h2>
<p>For example, if you frequently visit websites and blogs about

interest as you browse the web. <a href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/example/advertising-services.html">Learn more.</a></p>
<h2 id="summary-sensors">"and other sensors"</h2>
<p>Your device may have sensors that provide information to assist in a 
better understanding of your location. For example, an accelerometer can
 be used to determine things like speed, or a gyroscope to figure out 
direction of travel. <a href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/example/sensors.html">Learn more.</a></p>
<h2 id="summary-collect-information">"collect information"</h2>
<p>This includes information like your usage data and preferences, Gmail

<p>For example, you could get suggestions of people you might know or 
want to connect with on Google+, based on the connections you have with 
people on other Google products, like Gmail and people who have a 
connection with you may see your profile as a suggestion. <a href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/example/connect-with-people.html">Learn more.</a></p>
<h2 id="summary-credit-card">"credit card"</h2>
<p>Whilst we currently don’t ask for a credit card during sign up, 
verifying your age through a small credit card transaction is one way to
